* *[Conscription: Signaling or Human Capital Accumulation?](https://boyuanw1.github.io/files/Korean_conscription.pdf)* 

<details>

Abstract

</summary>

Many studies have found that conscription raises wages. One explanation for the wage premium is that conscripts accumulate valuable human capital during their service in the military. 
An alternative theory posits that conscription serves as a signaling device for a worker’s quality such
as good health and perseverance. This paper examines those possible mechanisms by estimating the impact of the duration of military service
on income, employment, and educational attainment with data from South Korea and an IV approach. While the amount of human capital
increases with the duration of service, the signal does not. Although I find a conscription premium: a positive relationship between conscription
and income, the length of compulsory military service does not affect a worker’s income or employment. On the contrary, I find that longer service
length lowers conscripts’ chances of obtaining post-graduate degrees suggesting a net human capital depreciation. My findings weaken the
case for human capital as an explanation for the conscription premium and strengthen support for a signaling mechanism.

* *[The Heterogeneous Effects of Uncertainty on Divorces](https://boyuanw1.github.io/files/Information_and_Divorce.pdf)*

Abstract

</summary>

Existing work shows that uncertainty created by a lack of information
about the other partner before marriage leads to more divorces.
In this paper, I use the different timing of the adoption of
anti-discrimination legislation in Japan, which bans the identification
of the Burakumins, to examine the effect of uncertainty on divorces
with a difference-in-differences approach. I show that an increase in
such uncertainty has heterogeneous effects on divorces. I find that an
increase in uncertainty increases divorces in places where the information
is less important and decreases divorces when that information is
more important.

* *[Did Big Pharma Influence the Adoption of COVID Vaccine Mandates?](https://boyuanw1.github.io/files/vax_mandate.pdf)*

<details>
<summary>

Abstract

</summary>

This paper examines whether campaign contributions from pharmaceutical
companies have an impact on the U.S. state lawmakers’ votes
on COVID vaccine legislation. I find state legislators tend to vote in
the pharmaceutical companies’ favor if they receive contributions from
those companies. My findings are consistent with pharmaceutical companies
using a small amount of campaign contributions to buy access to
lawmakers in hopes of lobbying them on the issue later.
