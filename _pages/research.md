* *[Conscription: Signaling or Human Capital Accumulation?](https://boyuanw1.github.io/files/Korean_conscription.pdf)* 

<details>
<summary>

Abstract

</summary>

One explanation for why conscription may raise wages is that conscripts accumulate valuable human capital during their service in the
military. An alternative theory posits that conscription affects labor market outcomes through the extensive margin.
The first paper examines those possible
mechanisms by estimating the impact of the duration of military service
on income, employment, and educational attainment with data from
South Korea and an IV approach. While the amount of human capital
increases with the duration of service, there is no effect on the extensive margin. Although I
find a conscription premium: a positive relationship between conscription
and income, the length of compulsory military service does not affect a
worker’s income or employment. On the contrary, I find that longer service length lowers conscripts’ chances of obtaining post-graduate degrees
suggesting a net human capital depreciation. My findings support the case that conscription primarily affects labor market outcomes through the extensive margin. \par

* *[The Heterogeneous Effects of Uncertainty on Divorces](https://boyuanw1.github.io/files/Information_and_Divorce.pdf)*

Abstract

</summary>

Existing work shows that uncertainty created by a lack of information
about the other partner before marriage leads to more divorces.
In this paper, I use the different timing of the adoption of
anti-discrimination legislation in Japan, which bans the identification
of the Burakumins, to examine the effect of uncertainty on divorces
with a difference-in-differences approach. I show that an increase in
such uncertainty has heterogeneous effects on divorces. I find that an
increase in uncertainty increases divorces in places where the information
is less important and decreases divorces when that information is
more important.

* *[Did Big Pharma Influence the Adoption of COVID Vaccine Mandates?](https://boyuanw1.github.io/files/vax_mandate.pdf)*

<details>
<summary>

Abstract

</summary>

This paper examines whether pharmaceutical companies directly lobbied U.S. state lawmakers for their votes on COVID vaccine legislation.
I find that state legislators who received campaign contributions from
pharmaceutical companies are not likelier to vote in favor of those
companies on the vaccine mandates. Prior field experiments have shown
that campaign contributions buy access, and the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry has directly influenced key state referenda on drug pricing and
regulation reforms with its political contributions. While Democrats
have primarily voted for the vaccine mandates, it can be quite costly for
Republicans to do the same. Journalists find that the industry remained
largely in the background of the controversial vaccine mandate policies
and relied primarily on third-party organizations to advance its agenda.
The findings of this paper provide evidence for this observation.
