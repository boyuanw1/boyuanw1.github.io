Abstract

</summary>

Many studies have found that conscription raises wages. One explanation for the wage premium is that conscripts accumulate valuable human capital during their service in the military. 
An alternative theory posits that conscription serves as a signaling device for a worker’s quality such
as good health and perseverance. This paper examines those possible mechanisms by estimating the impact of the duration of military service
on income, employment, and educational attainment with data from South Korea and an IV approach. While the amount of human capital
increases with the duration of service, the signal does not. Although I find a conscription premium: a positive relationship between conscription
and income, the length of compulsory military service does not affect a worker’s income or employment. On the contrary, I find that longer service
length lowers conscripts’ chances of obtaining post-graduate degrees suggesting a net human capital depreciation. My findings weaken the
case for human capital as an explanation for the conscription premium and strengthen support for a signaling mechanism.
